Step 2: Registration Form 📝
Current State: Simple form with validation checkmarks Major Improvements Needed:

🎨 Visual hierarchy: Form feels cramped and lacks breathing room
📱 Input field design: Current fields are too dark and hard to read
✅ Better validation: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
🚀 Progressive disclosure: Show fields one at a time for better focus


Step 3: Qualification Questions ❓
Current State: Simple button selection interface Improvements:

🎯 Visual engagement: Add icons to each option for better recognition
📊 Progress indicator: Show users where they are in the qualification process
🎨 Button design: Current buttons are too plain, need more visual appeal
💡 Context: Add brief explanations for why these questions matter

Step 4: Prize Wheel 🎰
Current State: Functional wheel with good color contrast Improvements:

✨ Animation enhancement: Add anticipation before spinning starts
🎉 Celebration effects: Confetti or particle effects when winning
