<h2>Why Your Current Leads Are Costing You Money</h2>
Surveys show that nearly half of all salespeople fail to meet their quota every year. This is because sales behaviors are often not aligned with how customers make buying decisions. Your sales team wastes precious time chasing leads who lack buying intent.
Our System Solves the Sales Disconnect by Answering Hoffeld's "Six Whys":
• Filter for "Why Change?" We use targeted qualification questions to uncover the prospect's pain point and what is undesirable about their current situation, justifying the need for a solution.
• Validate the "Why Now?" Factor: We gather key data points (e.g., purchasing timeline) that help your sales team prioritize prospects with the highest propensity to buy.
• Generate Distinct Value: Your offering gains unique appeal because attendees volunteer high-value information, positioning your solution as the only one that meets their specific needs (distinct value)



<h2>The Scan-to-Win Difference: Qualification by Design</h2>
Gamification works because it appeals to the psychological drivers of achievement and reward. We leverage the highly engaging Spin-to-Win mechanism to motivate attendees to complete the necessary qualification steps.
1. High-Engagement Entry: The QR Code and Spin-to-Win promise clear immediate value, increasing foot traffic (gamified booths see 40% more visitors) and attendee engagement (up to 73% higher).
2. Contact Validation (Friction for Quality):
    ◦ Action: Attendee enters Name, Email, and Phone. They receive a verification code they must enter.
    ◦ Exhibitor Benefit: This step achieves guaranteed data integrity and eliminates spam, ensuring your sales reps are contacting genuine prospects. The required entry of the code is an incremental commitment that builds momentum toward the larger goal.
3. Lead Qualification (Intent Capture):
    ◦ Action: Attendee answers your 2 mandatory qualifying questions.
    ◦ Exhibitor Benefit: We use multiple-choice/drop-down menus to reduce the physical length of the form and limit the amount of anxiety a visitor has. This instantly converts Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) into Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs).
4. Prize Delivery:
    ◦ Action: Attendee receives the code to spin the digital wheel at your booth.
    ◦ Exhibitor Benefit: The prize acts as reciprocity, rewarding the attendee for the high commitment required, leaving them with a positive brand feeling.
