# Trust & Credibility

- **Near-CTA trust**: Add 3–5 recognizable logos in a slim bar under the hero CTA (monochrome is fine).
- **Testimonials**: Keep density; standardize role/company and add one metric (e.g., “45% lift in verified leads”).
- **Proof links**: Add a short “See case study” link near the video or pricing persuasion column.
- **Assurances**: Microcopy near CTA/modal: “No long-term contracts. Secure & compliant. Setup fees waived during promo.”
