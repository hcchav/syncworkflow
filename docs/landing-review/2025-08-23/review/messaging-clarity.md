# Messaging Clarity

- **Headline**: Clear and benefit-led. Consider tightening to: “Attract more qualified leads at your booth.”
- **Subheadline**: “3× higher conversions for exhibitors” is strong. If available, add timeframe or data source for credibility.
- **Hero bullets (make outcome-first, quantified)**:
  - Capture 3× more emails in under 30 seconds with instant QR forms
  - Drive 2× more booth interactions using instant prizes
  - Prioritize outreach 50% faster with auto-qualified leads (cold • warm • hot)
- **Audience callout**: Add supporting line under the headline: “Built for trade show exhibitors, B2B field marketing, and event teams.”
